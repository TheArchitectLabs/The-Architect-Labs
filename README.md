# Welcome...

## to my personal projects page. These applications are works-in-progress while I learn programming for iOS. Enjoy the projects and provide any constructive criticism.

### Mastermind

**<u>Description:</u>** The first game I always try to create when learning a new programming language. It has logic and design at it's forefront and is always a challenging build.

<u>**History:**</u> The game is based on an older, paper based game called Bulls and Cows. A computer adaptation of it was run in the 1960s on Cambridge University‚Äôs Titan computer system, where it was called 'MOO'. This version was written by Frank King. There was also another version for the TSS/8 time sharing system, written by J.S. Felton and finally a version for the Multics system at MIT by Jerrold Grochow.

The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. Meirowitz presented the idea to many major toy companies but, after showing it at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair, it was picked up by a plastics company, Invicta Plastics, based near Leicester, UK. Invicta purchased all the rights to the game and the founder, Edward Jones-Fenleigh, refined the game further. It was released in 1971‚Äì2.

__**Description:**__ A word game I found on Paul Hudson's ([@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws)) HWS+. I have taken his project and added features I thought would make the game more fun and challenging.

### Affirmation!

<u>**Description:**</u> Another word game based on a project found in Paul Hudson's ([@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws)) 100 Days of SwiftUI lecture series.

<u>**Inspiration:**</u> The development of this game is inspired by my wife. She loves to write a word or phrase on a piece of paper and see how many words she can make out of that word or phrase. So old-school! As I was learning iOS programming, I wanted her to be able to play on her phone. Hence, Affirmation! was developed. Thank you, my beautiful wife, for always standing by me and listening to the techno-ramblings while I try to learn new programming languages.
